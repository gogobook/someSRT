FRANCESCO NERIERI:
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,098
Welcome to Firebase
Notifications.

4
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:06,994
[BANG]

5
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:11,046
[LAUGHTER]

6
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:12,860


7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,660
In this session, I'm
Francesco and I'm

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,930
going to introduce why we
believe that notifications

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,670
are important.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,870
Later on, Ting Mui,
our product manager,

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,060
will come onstage
and introduce what

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,410
we have built so you can use
Notifications effectively.

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,000


14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
And finally, Laurence,
our launch and T-shirt guy

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,330
and developer
advocate, will show you

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,412
this product with a few demos.

17
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:40,960


18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,210
So let's begin.

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,990
Why Notifications?

20
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,790
When we embark in the journey
of developing an application,

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,400
we all dream about its success.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,030
We think about
how much our users

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,260
will love our applications.

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,730
We want them to come
to the [INAUDIBLE]

25
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,680
and want more and more.

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,490
Because user engagement
plays a really big role

27
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,400
in application development.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,270
And notifications
are those messages

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,660
that pop in front of a user
to grab their attention.

30
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,039
And hopefully, they make them
do something that we want to.

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,550
A month ago, I bought
a ticket to a festival.

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,050
And this application
is reminding me

33
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,440
that, in three days,
the festival begins.

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,350
And maybe I should
come back to the app

35
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,800
and check the final lineup,
or buy tickets for a shuttle,

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,500
or schedule the concerts and
share them with my friends.

37
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,130
So notifications are really
powerful in getting the users

38
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,380
back into our application.

39
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,539
In fact, there are studies that
show that users that opt-in

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,340
to notifications are twice
as likely to come back,

41
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,880
as opposed to those that don't.

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,479
But if we send too
many notifications,

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,990
we might upset the user.

44
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,600
We overwhelm them, and we
achieve the opposite effect.

45
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,990
Users might silence the
notifications, or even worse,

46
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,300
uninstall our app.

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,310
So we need to get
a few things right.

48
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,840
We need to know when
is the right time

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,990
to send the notifications.

50
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,100
If I get a notification
now to come back to a game

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,750
and play a new level, it's
probably not as effective.

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,990
We need to understand
who we should target.

53
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,140
If we have a wetsuit sale,
and we target runners,

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,320
maybe we are not as effective
as if we target surfers.

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,452
And finally, what
is the message?

56
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,160
What we are trying to
convey to the user?

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,460
Because if we get
these things right,

58
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,610
there is when we grab
the user attention,

59
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,650
and we get them to
do what we need.

60
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,450
If we write an application
and we slip in a bug--

61
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,410
I know bugs happen, right?

62
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,090
We definitely have bugs
in our applications.

63
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,700
Not Laurence,
obviously, not Laurence.

64
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,429
Well, we want to target
just the population that

65
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,805
was affected by the bug.

66
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:56,180
We don't want to send an
apology to the entire population

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,880
of our users.

68
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,320


69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,019
So notifications are
really important.

70
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,810
But to get these things right,
we need some sort of feedback.

71
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,490
And here is when
analytics come to help.

72
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,310
Because with good
analytics data,

73
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,160
now we can improve our
engagement strategies.

74
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,359
And our marketing and
growth [INAUDIBLE]

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,265
people, they can spend
time in focusing on how

76
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,989
to increase our user base.

77
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,040
And our content editor
can send content updates

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,390
as they write their articles.

79
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,429
And our product
managers, like Ting Mui

80
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,920
here, they're super happy
they can send announcements

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,320
about new features that would
make the usage of the app

82
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,212
even more compelling.

83
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,339


84
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,680
So we think that this is very
important to get it right.

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,710
And here at Firebase, we
brought a new product that

86
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,912
will let you do exactly this.

87
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:46,370
Please welcome Ting Mui to show
you Firebase Notifications.

88
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,188


89
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,596
[APPLAUSE]

90
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,070


91
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,750
TING MUI LI: Thank
you, Francesco.

92
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,440
So let's take a look at
Firebase Notifications.

93
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,820
It is part of the
Firebase product.

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,910
And Firebase is a suite
of integrated products

95
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,160
that helps you to develop
your apps, grow a user base,

96
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,976
and earn money.

97
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:17,200


98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,810
Francesco just mentioned
that a notification

99
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,040
is really important in
helping you to engage users.

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,230
With the right contacts
and the right analytics,

101
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,430
it could be even more powerful.

102
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,060
But the process
has to be simple,

103
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,330
so that people can
really focus on getting

104
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,070
the content of the message.

105
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,599
Sending an
interesting message is

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,320
going to bring your user
back much more effectively.

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,520
So let's see how
Firebase Notification is

108
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
going to help you achieve that.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,190


110
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,700
Many of you are familiar with
Firebase Cloud Messaging,

111
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,485
the new version of
Google Cloud Messaging.

112
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,175
It has been reliably
delivering messages

113
00:04:56,175 --> 00:05:00,600
to Android, iOS,
and Chrome users.

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,440
Firebase Notifications is
built on top of Firebase Cloud

115
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,000
Messaging.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,640
It is cross-platform.

117
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,320
It's designed so that you
can set the right target

118
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,310
with the right contacts
and be able to evaluate

119
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,450
the effectiveness after.

120
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,190
It is simple, as you can
see from this console.

121
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,350
Anyone should be able to send
a notification or a message

122
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,570
without having to write a
single line of server code,

123
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,380
so that you can really
focus on getting the content

124
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,320
of your message right.

125
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,650
But it is not just
a form so that you

126
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,640
have to fill out all
the mandatory fields

127
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,990
before you can send a message.

128
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,780
It's designed so that you
can set the right target

129
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,640
by using analytic insight, FCM
topics, or even device and ad

130
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,219
info.

131
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,690
Once you have designed
your right target,

132
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,520
it's about engaging your
user with the right contacts.

133
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,150
For example, use
language so that you

134
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,429
can localize your message,
so that your Italian users

135
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,500
will not be getting a
German message, for example.

136
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,980
Or send your message
so that it's delivered

137
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,122
based off the user's time zone.

138
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:21,330
You don't have to worry
about waking the user at 3:00

139
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,940
AM in the morning, get them
mad, turn off notifications,

140
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,330
and potentially say bye
to your applications.

141
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,810
Every application has
its own customizations.

142
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,030
And you can do that by using
the Custom data fields.

143
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,729
You can pass in a
dynamic link, so

144
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,930
that you can take the
user to the right contacts

145
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,265
and the right flow of your app.

146
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:48,070
Or provide a discount
code so that you

147
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,051
can apply the discount
when users tap and open

148
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:51,842
your notifications.

149
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,630


150
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,280
You've just seen how easy
it is to send notifications.

151
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,119
But is it effective?

152
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,050
Is it actually bringing
more of your users

153
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,610
back, not having that much
of a difference, or actually,

154
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,860
turning your user away?

155
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,120
Firebase Notification
is integrated

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,660
with Firebase Analytics
and provides you

157
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,310
with a default set
of analytics so

158
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,515
that you can understand
the effectiveness right out

159
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:19,015
of the box.

160
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:22,010


161
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,590
When sending a message,
a lot of the time,

162
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,960
there's a goal that
we want to achieve.

163
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,440
And you can set that by
using Conversion events.

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
We track Sent and Opened
for you by default.

165
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,350
But obviously, you
can provide your own.

166
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,134
So now, let's go take
a look at the console

167
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:44,800
and see where you can
find the analysis.

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,113


169
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,738
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Switch to the laptop.

170
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:55,092


171
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,050
TING MUI LI: All right.

172
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,240


173
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,010
So what you are seeing here
is the Firebase Console.

174
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,980
And you can find
Notifications under Growth,

175
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,360
because we believe
that it can really

176
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,159
help you to re-engage your users
to improve their experience.

177
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,950
So this is where you
have all the campaigns

178
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,890
that you're managing.

179
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,240
If you click on one of the
campaigns that has already

180
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,760
been completed-- it's loading.

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,140
All right.

182
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,560
This is where you're
going to see the analysis,

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,110
the notification funnel.

184
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,799
So there's some interesting
data here-- the number of Sent

185
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,970
and how many of your
users actually haven't

186
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,450
opened your notifications.

187
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,420
So apparently, this
particular promotion

188
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,870
is not as effective
in getting the user

189
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,590
to open the notifications.

190
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,080
So we need to do better there.

191
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,290
And if you actually
provide conversion events

192
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,410
when you send
notifications, we will

193
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,209
track the number of
times your user actually

194
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,201
clicked the particular actions
that will lead to that event.

195
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,850


196
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,450
So this gives you
the basic insight

197
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,440
of notification effectiveness.

198
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,310
If you want to do
more analysis, this

199
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,426
is when you go to Analytics.

200
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,010
So there's one trick
that I would like

201
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,660
to share with you here today.

202
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,170
So if you go to Analytics and
look for Notification Opened

203
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,069
under the Events tab, this will
bring you the default Analytic

204
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,580
Event Report View.

205
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,430
So you'll see the total count,
the breakdown by messages

206
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,870
and topics, as well as
a breakdown by location

207
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,295
and demographic, if those
data are available to you.

208
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,670
The trick that I
want to show you

209
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:50,110
is if you actually click on
one of the messages up here,

210
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,600
it will actually
automatically apply filters

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,220
to all the Dashboards and all
the Event Reports in Analytics.

212
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,990
So now you can really
do some serious analysis

213
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,080
of how this particular
notification campaign actually

214
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,120
impacts your underlying
success matrix and factors.

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,350
So now let's go back to
the presentation, please.

216
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,780


217
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,589
All right.

218
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,090
So you've just seen the
product walk-through.

219
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,680
So now, Laurence, our
developer advocate,

220
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,790
is going to show us some demos.

221
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,719
LAURENCE MORONEY: I don't
know about you guys,

222
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,550
but I'm a really,
really lazy programmer.

223
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,359
So I really like to write as
few lines of code as possible.

224
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
But yeah, thank you.

225
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,010
So actually, before I
demo, I get one of these.

226
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,200
I got my demo wrong earlier.

227
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,866
I was fixing it.

228
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:39,319
So let me see if I can--
OK, I see people waving.

229
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,050
Oh!

230
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,550
Short.

231
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,939


232
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,069
So I'm a very lazy
programmer, in general.

233
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:47,110
I like to write as few
lines of code as possible.

234
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,724
I want things to be made as
easy for me as they can be.

235
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:51,890
And that's one of the things
that really attracts me

236
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,080
to Firebase Notifications,
because it's just

237
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,050
so easy as a developer.

238
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,010
And so, first of all, I want
to talk about two scenarios

239
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,189
for building applications.

240
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,160
And one is when you're
receiving notifications

241
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,124
in the background.

242
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:05,290
And I want to talk about
just how easy it is for you

243
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,300
to build a code for doing that.

244
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,459
So the first one I'm
going to show is here's

245
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,425
the code that you do if you
want to receive background

246
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:14,275
notifications in iOS.

247
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:17,850


248
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,620
Any other lazy developers here?

249
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,511
A single line of
code, and I mean,

250
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,260
technically, it's not
even a line of code.

251
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,020
It's a line of
configuration, right?

252
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,120
You add a single pod to
your iOS application,

253
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,746
and you use the
Firebase Messaging pod.

254
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,453
A lot of people ask,
well, why messaging?

255
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:33,382
Why not notifications?

256
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,930
And you may be familiar
with Google Cloud Messaging,

257
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,805
and now it's new evolution,
the Firebase Cloud Messaging.

258
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:41,055
They are so similar, and the
underlying infrastructure

259
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:42,530
is used in the same
way, that we said,

260
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,339
there's no point in shipping
two sets of libraries,

261
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,560
because they're so similar.

262
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,280
So if you incorporate the
Firebase Messaging pod

263
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
into your iOS application,
you can also then

264
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,952
grow into Firebase
Cloud Messaging as well.

265
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:55,410
But all you've got to do is
put this into your application,

266
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,589
and you're good to go.

267
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,250
And then for Android,
it's almost as easy.

268
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,690
You just build this into
your build.gradle file.

269
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,856
You're going to compile
com.google.firebase:firebase

270
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,689
messaging:3.0.0.

271
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,200
And that's it.

272
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,350
So if you create
an application--

273
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,450
and I'm going to demo
in just a moment, where

274
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,480
I used Android Studio, and
I did File, New Application.

275
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,230
And if you're an Android
Studio developer,

276
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,771
you're probably familiar with
the MT activity template, which

277
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,040
just gives you a &quot;Hello World.

278
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,089
That's all I did.

279
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,780
And then I added this
line to the build.gradle.

280
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,857
And let's demo it now.

281
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,189
Can we switch to the WolfVision?

282
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,430


283
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,599
So I have an app running
in the background now,

284
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,303
and Ting Mui is going to send
a notification to this app.

285
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:36,802
Yeah.

286
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:37,610
Yeah.

287
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,060
TING MUI LI: Can we switch
to the laptop, please.

288
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,226
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
sorry, switch to the laptop.

289
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:46,625


290
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,610
TING MUI LI: All right.

291
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,270
So let's see.

292
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,290
Let's start sending
a notification.

293
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,129
What shall I send?

294
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,670
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What should we say?

295
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,920
What kind of notification,
just so you know it's real.

296
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,222
Any hockey fans here?

297
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:01,470
AUDIENCE: Right here.

298
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,885
LAURENCE MORONEY: Who's
going to win the Stanley Cup?

299
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:03,900
AUDIENCE: The Penguins.

300
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Penguins?

301
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:04,870
Oh, wow.

302
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,574
OK.

303
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:06,990
Who said the Seattle
Thunderbirds?

304
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,930
You're my hero.

305
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,630
They're not even in it.

306
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,000
OK, let's send Penguins.

307
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,735
Oops, sorry.

308
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:14,651
TING MUI LI: Penguins.

309
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:17,829


310
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,330
All right.

311
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:24,190


312
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,240
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Easier this way.

313
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,010
All right, so can we
switch back to the phone?

314
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,922
So now earlier, you
saw the phone was just

315
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:32,880
sitting on the desktop.

316
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,463
And the notification
has just come in.

317
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,520
You can see it up in
my notification tray.

318
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,780
So now if I slide
down from that,

319
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,581
my application was just called
Firebase Notification 1.

320
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,330
And you can see Ting
Mui has actually sent

321
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,890
the notification, Penguins.

322
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,480
And then if I touch on that,
it's going to launch the app.

323
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,370
And this is the familiar &quot;Hello
World&quot; app from Android Studio.

324
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,080
I wrote no code to
be able to get that.

325
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,270
And that's pretty cool, right?

326
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,770
[APPLAUSE]

327
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,829


328
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,670
I've never had so many applause
for doing nothing before.

329
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,857
This is great.

330
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,689
So can we switch back
to the slides, please?

331
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,500


332
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,257
So that was background
notifications.

333
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:12,839
And then people say,
OK, that's great.

334
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,660
But what about when the
app is in the foreground?

335
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,600
What about if I want to
be able to do things,

336
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,099
and I want to receive
a notification

337
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,500
and have it maybe change
an activity in my app

338
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,180
while the app is
in the foreground?

339
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,849
The classic example
of this is if you're

340
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,470
using some kind of
IP telephony app,

341
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,090
and then you receive
an incoming call.

342
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,620
It's going to
change your activity

343
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,330
to be able to handle
the incoming call.

344
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,540
In most cases, you
want to answer.

345
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,949
In some cases, you
want to ignore.

346
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,408
And you've got all
that kind of UI.

347
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,380
So you're changing
the context of the app

348
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,720
upon receiving a notification

349
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:38,886


350
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:40,760
So let's take a look at
how we would actually

351
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,939
do this in this case.

352
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,746
And I'm still a
very lazy developer,

353
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:46,370
so it's not a whole lot of work,
but it's a little bit of work,

354
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,590
and it's a little bit more.

355
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,180
So in Android, here's
all I have to do.

356
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,170
OK, I'm going to
create a service class.

357
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,546
In this case, I call it my
Firebase Messaging Service.

358
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:56,630
Because like I said, I'm
a really lazy programmer,

359
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,050
and I have no imagination
about what to call the thing.

360
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,050
And I specify an
intent filter on that

361
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,233
so that it will handle
particular actions,

362
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,650
so that this class is the one
that will handle the action.

363
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,150
And the action that
I want to handle

364
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,660
is com.google.firebase.MESSAGING
EVENT.

365
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,170
So what I'm saying is that
once I compile my application,

366
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,050
and I have that
service class in there,

367
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,959
if this application is
running on the device,

368
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,900
whenever an incoming
message comes,

369
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,870
an incoming
notification comes, then

370
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,199
this class, the Firebase
Messaging Service Class,

371
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,740
is the one that's
going to handle it.

372
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,230
And this class would look
a little bit like this.

373
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,040
So it's just straightforward
Java code here.

374
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,660
This is my lazy
MyFirebaseMessagingService.

375
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,449
And I'm going to extend the
base Firebase Messaging Service

376
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,820
class for that.

377
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,040
And then whenever I receive a
message, once I'm extending,

378
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,110
then I just receive
this onMessageReceived,

379
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,147
and it's going to
contain a remote message.

380
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:47,730
And then there's a
bunch of attributes

381
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,250
of that remote message that
I can do something with.

382
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,180
I put together a
screencast of this that

383
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,531
went on YouTube last night.

384
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,030
And one question that somebody
asked me was, well, how would

385
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,829
I generate a custom
notification?

386
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,170
So take, for example,
Android M and Android N.

387
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,670
We have the ability to
have a custom notification,

388
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,829
and you can reply, or you
can do something directly

389
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,810
in the notification.

390
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,191
Here's where you would do that.

391
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:10,650
You're receiving
the remote message

392
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,257
N. You can parse metadata
out of that remote message.

393
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,089
And then you can generate
a new notification

394
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,420
that you would then render
in Android with that custom

395
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,910
stuff on there.

396
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,770
Also, if you have an Android
Wear watch connected to it,

397
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,441
you can send the
notifications there.

398
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,940
So there's lots of really fun
and lots of really great stuff

399
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,770
that you can do.

400
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,730
And this is really all
the code that you have

401
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,220
to do to be able to do that.

402
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,770
It's you create the service.

403
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,480
You create the intent filter.

404
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,240
Your service has to extend
Firebase Messaging Service.

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,640
And then you handle your stuff
in the onMessageReceived.

406
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,996
Pretty straightforward,
pretty easy, right?

407
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,620
And then people go,
but what about iOS?

408
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,570
I say, OK, iOS.

409
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,170
Now, forgive me,
my slides, I tend

410
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,660
to use Objective-C. I haven't
become a fan of Taylor Swift

411
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,160
yet.

412
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,850
So--

413
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,804
[LAUGHTER]

414
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,220
--people are
laughing at my jokes.

415
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,317
This is great.

416
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:57,440
So my last session,
nobody laughed.

417
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
So when you're writing
an iOS application,

418
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,630
you just have your
application have

419
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,700
a didReceiveRemoteNotification
handler on that.

420
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,567
That's the second
line of code here.

421
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,400
And that's going to
receive an NSDictionary.

422
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,680
And if you're in Objective-C
or an iOS programmer,

423
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,221
you're familiar with
an NSDictionary.

424
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:13,888
It's just a set of
name value pairs.

425
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,179
So there's going to be a set
of name value pairs, keys,

426
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,849
and the value for that.

427
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:19,785
So as you can see here,
the userinfo bracket

428
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:21,619
key that I'm doing
there, that would be just

429
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:22,540
where I read out the keys.

430
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,705
Like maybe it's the Message
ID, or the Message Body,

431
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:25,780
or something like that.

432
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,670
And then I could do something
interesting with that in iOS.

433
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,040
So shall we see this in action?

434
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,790
What do you think?

435
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,280
TING MUI LI: Why not?

436
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,220
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

437
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,600
So can we switch to
the laptop, please?

438
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,169
Actually, switch back to
the phone first, please.

439
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,360
And I have my application here
running in the foreground,

440
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,580
and it's the same File,
New, &quot;Hello World&quot;

441
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,319
application from Android
Studio, except I added a service

442
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,110
class to that with all
the code that I just

443
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,260
showed you on the slide,
and I'm running it.

444
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,650
And now, can we switch
to the laptop, please?

445
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,980
And Ting Mui will
send a notification.

446
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,500
What kind of thing
should we send?

447
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,450
What do you think?

448
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,020
Something other than Penguins,
because I don't really

449
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,680
like the Penguins.

450
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,120
TING MUI LI: Oh.

451
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well, Sidney
Crosby's good, but I don't--

452
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,620
TING MUI LI: Turtles?

453
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,703
LAURENCE MORONEY: Turtles.

454
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:06,230
There's no hockey team called
the Turtles, but that's OK.

455
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,060
Name a hockey team.

456
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,726
AUDIENCE: Sharks

457
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:11,170
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Sharks, thank you.

458
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,750
A former Seattle star plays for
the Sharks, Patrick Marleau,

459
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,770
so I'm a big Sharks fan.

460
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,603
TING MUI LI: Sharks?

461
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:16,850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sharks.

462
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,805
They're going to
win tonight, right?

463
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,010
TING MUI LI: We'll see.

464
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,806
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
as Ting Mui sends that,

465
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,430
can we now switch to
the phone, please?

466
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,030


467
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,240
And we should see an
incoming notification

468
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,041
is going to change my activity.

469
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:31,916
Drum roll, everybody.

470
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,600


471
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,573
[DRUM ROLL]

472
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,740
Thank you for the drum roll.

473
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,000
There it is.

474
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
And we see this activity
now that comes in.

475
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,939
And this was launched in
response to the notification.

476
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,795
So in that slide,
where I showed you

477
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:46,670
earlier on that I've
received a notification,

478
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,090
and I received data, I
have another activity

479
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,959
that I just launched, stuck
that data in a bundle,

480
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,390
so it was the From and the text.

481
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,520
And then in this activity,
I ran to the text.

482
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,650
It was really, really
as simple as that.

483
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,110
We're probably talking
15 lines of code, total,

484
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,560
to do the whole thing.

485
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,200
And this is me receiving
custom notifications

486
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,240
from Firebase Notifications
and actually doing

487
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,070
something active with that.

488
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,570
How easy is that?

489
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,550
What are we going
to do next year?

490
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,889
So with that, so
Ting Mui, I would

491
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,294
like to pass it back to you.

492
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:18,460
And we're going to talk
about some customers, right?

493
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,370
TING MUI LI: Yep.

494
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,469
Can you go back to the
presentation, please?

495
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,900
And thank you, Laurence.

496
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,543
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.

497
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,489
[APPLAUSE]

498
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,960


499
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,180
I get applause because
I got the T-shirts.

500
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,890
TING MUI LI:
--shirts to send out.

501
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:42,980
All right, so I hope you guys
enjoy the T-shirts, as well as

502
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,770
the demos that we've
just shown you.

503
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,320
We definitely like it.

504
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,220
So we have to show
you how easy it

505
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,880
is to be able to send a
notification without using

506
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,310
the console, and also how simple
it is to actually integrate

507
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,360
on the client side.

508
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,590
We don't want to develop
a product in a vacuum.

509
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,280
So we have been gathering a
lot of developers' feedback.

510
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,850
And there are many
developers who

511
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,540
actually integrated with
Firebase Notifications already.

512
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,899
Today I would like to share the
experiences from three of them.

513
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,020
And for the rest, please go
to other Firebase session

514
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,200
and hear about
their experiences.

515
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,970
So first, App in the Air--
someone is taking a picture.

516
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,470
So App in the Air helps the
user to manage their travel

517
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,440
experience after
they have already

518
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,802
booked their flight ticket.

519
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,760
So they would get a flight
status change alert,

520
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,390
for example.

521
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,690
And what they found is
Firebase Notifications

522
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,450
is &quot;reliable and flexible.&quot;

523
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,330
And they were able
also to really allow

524
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,210
them to focus on the important
metrics of their app.

525
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,260
Busbud, an application that
helps you to book a bus ticket.

526
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,090
They will send you new route
information or a discount code.

527
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,169
And they were able to
integrate Firebase Analytics

528
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,830
really quickly, whilst you are
able to customize to their user

529
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,629
experiences.

530
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,290
Malang Studio is able to
use Firebase Notifications

531
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,755
in their latest application,
Chu Day, an application that

532
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:13,380
helps users to
celebrate anniversaries.

533
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,890


534
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,540
They have users
around the world.

535
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,030
And they are able to use a
time zone feature, so that they

536
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,870
don't have to worry about
sending notifications

537
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,469
after midnight and
disrupt their users.

538
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,000
So these are some really
interesting real-life examples

539
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,475
and testimonies on how flexible,
simple, and reliable Firebase

540
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:35,414
Notifications is.

541
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:38,430


542
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,190
So we have covered a lot today.

543
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,380
We talked about why
we think notifications

544
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,060
is important in engaging users,
what we've built to have you

545
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,210
to better engage your users.

546
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,162
And also, we showed
you some demos

547
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:51,370
and also partner's feedbacks.

548
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,510


549
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,110
In summary, there are
three key takeaways.

550
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,689
We built Firebase
Notifications so that anyone

551
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,720
can send notifications
without having to write

552
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,680
a single line of server code.

553
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,140
And we made the client
integration super simple

554
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,050
as well, so that you can focus
on getting the right user

555
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,260
with the right contacts.

556
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,710
And with a tight
integration with Analytics,

557
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,790
you'll be able to
measure the effectiveness

558
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,270
of your notifications.

559
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,730
We're really excited to announce

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,660
